# WebSocket Chat Demo

This project is a simple real-time chat application built to demonstrate the capabilities of WebSockets. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience with WebSocket technology and its deployment in a cloud environment.

## Key Features

The application aims to implement the following core features:

1.  **Real-time Bi-directional Communication:** Users connected to the chat application can send messages that are instantly broadcast to all other connected users. This showcases the full-duplex nature of WebSockets.
2.  **Scalable Cloud Deployment (AWS):** The application is designed to be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using API Gateway (for WebSocket management) and Lambda functions, demonstrating a modern, serverless approach to hosting WebSocket services.

## Technologies Used (Initial)

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript)
* **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript, `ws` library (for WebSockets), `Express.js` (for serving static files)
* **Deployment:** AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB (for connection management)
* **Tooling:** npm, Serverless Framework, Git, GitHub

## Getting Started (Coming Soon!)

Instructions on how to set up and run this project locally, as well as deployment steps, will be added here.
